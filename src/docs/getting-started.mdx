> The course begins with basic concepts and becomes increasingly involved throughout the semester. Multiple technologies are needed. <br /><br />
> The best way to start in this course is by installing the following:


**Node**
-

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
We use Node in COMP2406 beginning Tutorial 1.

We can install Node by following the instructions [here](https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs). 


But, if you prefer, you can install and configure Node manually by following along [here](/technologies/node).

**npm**
-

npm is used to help manage all of our packages we use throughout the course. More info [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm).


**MongoDB**
-

From MongoDB's website: 

"MongoDB is a modern, general-purpose document database that has been widely paired with Node.js in popular tech stacks such as the [MEAN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mean-stack) (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js) and the [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js)."

We're using a similar stack in this class, minus the use of react. Mongo, Express, Pug, and Node.

Instructions on how to install MongoDB can be found [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).

A section on install MongoDB is being worked on and will be added to the site shortly.
