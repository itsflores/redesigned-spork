# Installing Node

Installing Node differs depending on the OS you are running. We will install NodeJS using nvm. 

## Mac / Linux

1. Open your terminal

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
```

2. Now open a new terminal window

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```

<br />

```bash
nvm ls
```

3. Verify that you see something like the following:

```bash
->       system
iojs -> N/A (default)
node -> stable (-> N/A) (default)
unstable -> N/A (default)
nvm_list_aliases:36: no matches found: /Users/joseph/.nvm/alias/lts/*
```

4. Now you can enter 

```bash
nvm install 14.15.4
```

> Note: v14.15.4 may be outdated by the time you follow these instructions. Make sure to install the version the prof suggests or the latest. 
 

5. Once that has been installed you can type the following. 

```bash
nvm use 14.15.4
```

6. Now type 

```bash
node -v
```

7. If you installed v14.15.4 then you should see 

```bash
14.15.4
```

returned to you in the terminal. If you get an error with 
```code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND',```
then try going through these steps again. 

<br />

## Windows

1. Go to nvm-windows repositories releases section [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases) and select the latest release.
2. Now, choose the nvm-setup.zip file and download it.
3. Unzip the file and run the installer.
4. Install Node using nvm by following the instructions below: 

```bash
nvm install 14.15.4
```
> Note: v14.15.4 may be outdated by the time you follow these instructions. Make sure to install the version the prof suggests or the latest. 

```bash
nvm use 14.15.4
```

5. Check if node has been installed correctly: 
```bash
node -v
```

You should see ```14.15.4``` returned to you in the terminal. 
If you get an error with:
```code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND',```
then try going through these steps again.
