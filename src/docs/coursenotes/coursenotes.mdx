Learning web development is complex, and sifting through all of the available information relating to web development online can lead to even more frustration, confusion, and complexity. Here, work has been hand-selected to relate to core concepts students need to learn in COMP2406. In addition, we want to simplify the gathering of resources to help you know what you need to learn to succeed in the class.

Information here is based on content from Professor David McKenney's COMP2406 Fall 2021 course.
