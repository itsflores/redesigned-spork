Express is a popular Node web framework and provides many functions to support building a server.

Namely, Express can:

- Write handlers for various HTTP requests such as GET, POST, and PUT
- Work with template engines such as Pug
- Add middle-ware to support request pipelines

How do I add Express to my project?

To start working with Express, we first want to understand npm. When working with a framework similar to Express, we need to install it in our project as a dependency. We use npm to manage the installation. As our projects become more complex, we tend to use more modules and frameworks to support them. Notably, all npm packages contain a file usually in the project root called package.json. This file holds various metadata relevant to the project, including the project's dependencies. Where does package.json come from?

Well, we can add it by calling the following in the root of our project.

```bash
npm init
```

You will notice that you can now add a name, description, version number, and many other metadata to your new package.json. For now we can press "enter" while going through each prompt in the terminal. As a result, your package.json will look something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "default",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

Once we complete the creation of the package.json, we can install Express as a dependency by calling the following at the root of our project.

```bash
npm i express
```

Now our package.json looks like this: 

```json
{
  "name": "default",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
```

Notice that Express installs correctly and is listed as a dependency of the project. Also take note that there is a new folder in your directory called `./node_modules`.
`./node_modules` includes the files that allow Express to run. If you install another dependency those files will also be added to this folder. As you can imagine, `./node_modules` can grow quite large so we do not include this file when we submit tutorials or assignments. 
Simply delete `./node_modules` when you want to submit your assignment or tutorial and include instructions to run `npm i` before starting your server in your readme.

Now, let's add a file to the root of our project and name it `server.js`. 

`server.js` will be our project's main file. So let's add a field in our package.json to make it easy for someone to run our server. 

In our package.json make the following additions: 

```json
{
  "name": "default",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    "start": "node server.js",
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
```

Notice we changed main to point to `server.js` and we have added a new script called `start` that runs `node server.js` when we type the following command in our terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

Now we can add the Express module to `server.js` by adding this line of code: 

```js
const express = require("express");
```

Now we are ready to start working with Express.
