**Q:** How do I test receiving JSON versus HTML from my API? 

A: There are multiple ways, some use a program called Postman (found [here](https://www.postman.com/)) 

I'd suggest using curl commands in your terminal. Here is an example: 

`curl` commands (short for Client URL) allow us to communicate to our web application server by specifying a specific URL and the data that needs to be sent to or received from the server. Here is a generic example: 

```bash
curl -H "Accept: application/json" "YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" 
```

So, let's try testing our first endpoint; 

1. Run your server 
2. Open a new terminal window
3. run the following command: 

```bash
curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:3000/restaurants
```

1. Verify you received the correct JSON response. It should look something like: 

```json
{
"restaurants" : 
	[
	  restaurant1: id,
	  restuarant2: id,
	  restuarant3: id,
	],
}
```
