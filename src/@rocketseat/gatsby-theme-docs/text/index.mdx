**What is this site?** 

Welcome to the COMP2406 Unofficial Documentation. This website is intended for computer science undergraduates at Carleton University for use in the course COMP2406.

<br />

**Course Notes:**

The course notes will continue updating throughout the year.
Thus, you can use them as supplementary material on top of your lectures.
Also, these notes provide different perspectives on the material covered in the course.
